## About

```
42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology:
no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer
learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is
free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming
thus "cadets" (42's students).
```

For further information about 42's selection process (the "Piscine"), please visit the <a href="https://42.rio/#comoparticipar" style="color:white;font-weight:bold;">C Piscine</a>.

### NORMINETTE

At 42 School, it is expected that almost every project is written following the Norm, which is the coding standard of the school.

``` - No for, do...while, switch, case, goto, ternary operators, or variable-length arrays allowed;
- Each function must be a maximum of 25 lines, not counting the function's curly brackets;
- Each line must be at most 80 columns wide, with comments included;
- A function can take 4 named parameters maximum;
- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static);
- You can't declare more than 5 variables per function;
- ... 
```

## üåå 42's galaxy (curriculum)

**42cursus** comprises two groups of projects: the first one being known as _"inner circle"_ and the second one, _"outer treks"_ - due to the **Holy Graph** layout (see image below).

The **inner circle** is the basic curriculum, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimum level required for activities such as internships and interchange.

The **outer treks** is a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development which allows cadets to specialize on whatever subject they prefer.
