## About

```
42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology:
no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer
learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is
free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming
thus "cadets" (42's students).
```

For further information about 42's selection process (the "Piscine"), please visit the <a href="https://42.rio/#comoparticipar" style="color:white;font-weight:bold;">C Piscine</a>.
